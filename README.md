# Zara_project

Zara is a new programming language that has data types, `strings`, `float`, `integer`, `arrays` and `stack`. The operators are `equal sign`, `multiplication`, `division`, `subtraction`, `greater than`, `equal`. Furthermore, it has `if else`, `do while`, and `for loop`. Finally, it has `sub-programs` or `methods` plus `classes`. 

## Week 1: Overview of Compiler and Symbol Table

### Assignment:

•	Implement a basic symbol table for Zara, supporting variable declarations with their types (integer, float, string, array, and stack). Ensure the symbol table allows adding, updating, and retrieving symbols.
•	Write a Zara program with various data types and sub-programs, and verify the symbol table's accuracy by logging symbol entries.

## Week 2: Lexical Analysis

### Assignment:

•	Create a lexical analyzer for Zara that identifies tokens like keywords (if, else, do while), operators, data types, identifiers, and literals. Use regular expressions for token recognition.
•	Test the lexical analyzer on sample Zara code to verify correct tokenization.
